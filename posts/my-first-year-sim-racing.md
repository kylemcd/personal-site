title: "My first year sim racing: a journey of learning and community"

Over the past year, I've thrown myself headfirst into sim racing. What started with a dusty Logitech wheel from my dad turned into a full-blown obsession involving cockpit upgrades, direct-drive wheels, and deep dives into the complexities of race craft. I've learned a lot, both about motorsport and my own competitive nature, and I've made connections with people who enjoy nothing more than analyzing lap data on a Tuesday night.

Sim racing isn't a shallow pastime. It mirrors real-world racing in many ways, from pit-stop strategy and tire management to corner geometry and mental focus. Each race reveals something new—about technique, the physics in these modern sims, or the community behind it all.
## Starting from scratch

My journey began with an old Logitech wheel and plastic pedals. The setup didn't provide much force feedback, and I could feel the hardware straining when I cranked the steering in tight corners. Still, it was enough to show me how realistic sim racing can be. I spent the first few months spinning out in every other race, especially once I tried cars with more power than a basic Mazda MX-5. It was humbling, but it showed me how much I had to learn.

I decided to upgrade piece by piece. A Playseat Trophy cockpit gave me a stable platform, which stopped the rig from sliding across the floor under force-feedback loads. Next, I moved to Simagic pedals and a Simagic direct-drive wheelbase for sharper inputs and stronger, more nuanced feedback. Haptic feedback pedals helped me detect lock-ups, while a button box and display unit gave me better control over in-car settings. My most recent addition, a GSI Hyper P1 wheel, changed how I interact and engage with my car. Each upgrade brought me closer to that "real car" sensation.

## Going deeper into the driving craft

Sim racing forced me to rethink how to drive. This book titled, [Going Faster! Mastering the Art of Race Driving](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0837602262), exposed me to the basics of racing, expanding my vocabulary and understanding of the sport. "Slow in, fast out" no longer felt like an empty saying—it was the difference between spinning at corner exit and accelerating past the competition. I worked on trail braking to maintain stability while turning, and I learned how to create a controlled drift called "slip angle" to help rotate the car faster. Pushing that slip angle too far causes a spin, but getting it right shaves entire tenths off a lap.

Comparing telemetry data made my learning more focused. Tools like [Garage 61](https://garage61.net/) let me overlay my laps with laps from faster drivers, pinpointing exactly where I was braking too early or rolling on the throttle too late. It felt like I was close—my lines weren't miles off—but the tiny differences added up to seconds of lost time. These insights pushed me to refine every phase of each corner, from turn-in to exit.

## Memorable moments at the track

One race stands out as a turning point: a Toyota GR86 event at Virginia International Raceway's North Course. I qualified near the front but ran most of the race in second. On the final lap, I got a run on the leader down the main straight, braked later into Turn 1, and passed cleanly on the inside. I was proud that I didn't lock a wheel, overshoot the corner, or make contact. That pass was a simple move on paper, but it felt like proof that I'd put enough laps in to trust the car, the tires, and my own sense of timing.

I've had rough days, too—times when I spun every few corners or collected damage on Lap 1. Those moments reminded me that even small lapses in concentration can undo hours of practice. There's no quick fix for losing focus mid-race. I had to learn to reset my mindset after mistakes, or else I'd carry tension and frustration into the next corner.

## Strategies and lessons from real motorsport

My interest in Formula 1 grew as I delved into sim racing, and I realized how vital strategy is. Fuel management, tires, and pit timing all influence a race's outcome, and these same factors show up in iRacing endurance events. An undercut—pitting earlier—can jump someone in the pits, while an overcut—staying out longer—sometimes pays off if you manage consistent laps. In wet sessions, rain tires become the deciding factor, and you might have to guess when the track will dry enough for slicks.

Realism in sims has reached a point where direct-drive wheels replicate the torque of real cars to an impressive degree. While we can't feel true g-forces, we can sense the weight shift in corners and the subtle breakaway when tires lose grip. This helps explain why top drivers like Max Verstappen practice on simulators and why some sim racers have made the leap to actual racing teams. The skills transfer—smooth steering, precise braking, and consistent lap times.

## Finding community (and dealing with toxicity)

Sim racing is a friendly hobby when you look past the inevitable mid-race disputes. Incidents happen, and it's easy to blame the other driver. Sometimes it really is their fault—other times, a replay shows me that I turned in too soon or braked too late. Sharing telemetry helps resolve these disputes, and it also fosters camaraderie. I found a group of like-minded racers who love diving into data, building setups, and even signing up for endurance events like the 12 Hours of Bathurst.

Outside our smaller circle, iRacing's license system fuels more competition. Safety rating and iRating track everything from clean laps to race results. I don't chase a specific number, but it's satisfying to see my progress and move toward top splits. The system also ensures we race against drivers of similar skill, which keeps events more balanced.

## Bringing a gamer's mindset

Before sim racing, I competed in first-person shooters like Halo 3 and Hell Let Loose. That background gave me a drive to practice relentlessly, examine my mistakes, and search for incremental improvements. Sim racing is more solitary—once the lights go out, it's you and the car—but many of the same principles apply: learn the "map," predict opponents' moves, and commit to each action with confidence.

Being fast takes muscle memory. The more laps I turn, the less I think about gear changes or corner apexes. I start to feel when the car is loaded or when I'm on the edge of grip. That sense of flow is the same rush I got in competitive shooters when I knew exactly where to aim before an opponent even appeared.

## Mental focus and practice

Long races demand consistent focus. One slip can ruin your day, especially in endurance stints where your teammates rely on you to keep the car clean. I've seen how mental state affects pace—confidence leads to stable laps, but doubt causes me to lift early or brake too hard. Practice helps to minimize those mental wobbles. With enough reps, corners become instinctual. I also realized I need short breaks during practice to reset my brain. Pushing tired laps can reinforce bad habits.

Some of my best races happened when I felt calm and dialed in. I'd only notice the sweat after taking the checkered flag. That flow state is addictive, and it's a big reason I keep coming back to sim racing. It's not just about driving fast—it's about being in total control, lap after lap.

## Looking ahead

I want to keep pushing my limits and deepen my knowledge of each car's dynamics. Endurance events, like 24-hour races, appeal to me because they combine strategy, teamwork, and mental resilience. I'd also like to try more open-wheel cars, where aerodynamic grip and tire heat add new dimensions to the driving experience.

Most of all, I plan to keep enjoying each step. When sim racing starts to feel too stressful, I jump into a new series or run laps in a car I rarely drive. I've learned that variety renews my enthusiasm and broadens my skills. Every race is a chance to learn—from the opening lap chaos to that final push across the finish line.

Sim racing feels like an endless journey, and that's the best part. There's always another trick to master or a different approach to a corner. If you haven't tried it, grab any wheel you can find and turn a few laps. You might be surprised how deep this hobby goes—and how quickly it can pull you in.
